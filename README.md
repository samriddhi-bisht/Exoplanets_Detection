# exoplanets-detection
This project uses NASA's Kepler Space Telescope data to detect exoplanets by identifying periodic dips in star brightness caused by transiting planets. By analyzing this brightness-time data, the project aims to deploy a machine learning model that discover stars with orbiting exoplanets.
